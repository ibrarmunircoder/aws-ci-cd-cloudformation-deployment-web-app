## <p style="text-align:center">👋 Welcome to my AWS CI/CD Cloudformation Web Application Deployment Project 🌐</p>

### ✡ Introduction:

To deploy an application to production environment, you need to traditionally go through the process of creating or provisioning the infrastructure resources where your application runs on, connecting to the server, configuring the server and installing a bunch of softwares required to run the application etc. This deployment process requires a lot manual work and time-consuming task just to run the application on the production server. Imagine, you have to replicate the work to the development and staging environments. This can lead to inconsistent and mistakes between stages. The Traditional way to deploy applications is known to be error-prone. What if we implement a some kind automation in our processes to improve overall application release process. In the era of devops world, we can use many different tools and technologies to automate the deployment process of an application.

By embracing automation, we can significantly enhance the efficiency and reliability of application releases. This not only reduces the time required for deployment but also minimizes the potential for human errors. In summary, integrating automation into our deployment procedures is a hallmark of the DevOps era, enabling smoother, more consistent, and less error-prone application releases across different environments.
